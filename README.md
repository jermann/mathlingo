## API Endpoints

### `/api/problem`
Generates math problems with random question types and adaptive difficulty.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "topic": "Basic arithmetic",
  "difficulty": 3,
  "problemHistory": []
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "prompt": "Plot the following points: A(1,1), B(4,1), C(4,4), D(1,4). What shape do you get?",
  "type": "graphing",
  "difficulty": 3,
  "options": []
}
```

### `/api/solve`
Comprehensive endpoint that handles all question types with AI-powered grading.

**For Text/Multiple Choice/Graphing Questions:**
```json
{
  "problem": {
    "prompt": "What is 2 + 2?",
    "answer": "4",
    "solution": "Basic arithmetic fact.",
    "type": "text"
  },
  "answer": "4",
  "questionType": "text"
}
```

**For Drawing Questions (FormData):**
- `image`: Drawing image file
- `questionType`: "formula_drawing" or "graphing"

**Response:**
```json
{
  "extractedText": "2x + 3 = 11",
  "isCorrect": true,
  "feedback": "Excellent! You correctly wrote the equation 2x + 3 = 11."
}
```

### `/api/grade` (Legacy)
Legacy endpoint for basic grading - now superseded by `/api/solve`.

## Enhanced Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling
- **JSON parsing fallbacks** for malformed AI responses
- **Cache miss protection** with multiple fallback levels
- **Graceful degradation** - app never crashes, always provides working problems
- **Comprehensive logging** for debugging and monitoring

### üíæ Smart Caching
- **Timestamp-based cache** with automatic cleanup
- **Frontend state backup** for reliability
- **Memory leak prevention** with 30-minute cache expiration
- **Multiple fallback mechanisms** ensure data persistence

### üéØ Question Type Distribution
- **Random selection** from four question types
- **Topic-appropriate prompts** for each type
- **Difficulty scaling** across all question types
- **Consistent JSON structure** for reliable parsing

## Question Type Examples
